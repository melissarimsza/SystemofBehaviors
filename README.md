# System of Behaviors

The fish objects use a combinaiton of three different behaviors: flocking, spacing, and wandering to create the exhibited behaviors.

When the shark gets within a certain distance of the fish, it switches from wandering behavior to attack behavior until the fish get out of range.

This type of behaviors can be applied to any type of predator/prey scenario.
